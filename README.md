**Overview**

The ROS2RPI HAT is a powerful add-on board designed specifically for Raspberry Pi 4/5 models. It enhances the capabilities of your Raspberry Pi by providing a range of features, including:

- Dual Independent I2C Ports: Two I2C ports with individual power control, enabling flexible connectivity to a wide range of QWIC sensors.
- LIDAR Integration: A dedicated port for connecting LIDAR sensors, directly interfaced with the Raspberry Pi's hardware serial port.
- Active Cooling: A 30mm fan ensures optimal thermal performance, especially during intensive processing or sensor data acquisition.
- I2C GPIO Expander: The ROS2RPI Control HAT V4 utilizes an I2C GPIO expander to efficiently manage its functionalities, freeing up valuable Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for other applications.
- The ROS2RPI HAT offers a flexible serial port that can be configured for either LIDAR communication or external debugging. This dual-purpose functionality enables remote debugging and troubleshooting, enhancing the HAT's versatility and ease of use.

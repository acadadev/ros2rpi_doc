The ***ROS2RPI HAT*** is a powerful add-on board designed specifically for Raspberry Pi 4/5 models. It enhances the capabilities of your Raspberry Pi by providing a range of features, including:

- ***Dual Independent I2C Ports:*** Dual Bidirectional I2C Bus and Voltage-Level Translators, enabling flexible connectivity to a wide range of QWIC sensors.
- ***I2C GPIO Expander:*** The ROS2RPI HAT utilizes an I2C GPIO expander to efficiently manage its functionalities, freeing up valuable Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for other applications.
- ***LIDAR Integration:*** A dedicated port for connecting Lidar sensors, directly interfaced with the Raspberry Pi's hardware serial port.
- ***Active Cooling:*** A 30mm fan and metal heat sink at the bottom ensures optimal thermal performance, especially during intensive processing or sensor data acquisition.
- ***Serial Routing*** offers a flexible serial port that can be configured for either LIDAR communication or external debugging. This dual-purpose functionality enables remote debugging and troubleshooting, enhancing the HAT's versatility and ease of use.
